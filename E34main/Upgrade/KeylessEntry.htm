                  <p>Having just fitted a keyless entry system to my 5 series 
                    I thought I'd scribble it down so that other people can have 
                    an easier time doing the same thing!</p>
                  <p>As my car is a UK version, to save confusion instead of referring 
                    to the driver's side or the passenger side, I will call it 
                    the RIGHT or LEFT, from the perspective of standing behind 
                    the car looking forward to the front.</p>
                  <p>Only use a multimeter for testing the wires, as these have 
                    a high impedance and won't short anything out. <b>DON'T use 
                    a test light </b>(screwdriver with a croc clip and a bulb

                  <p><b>The System:<br>
                    </b>I bought the Omega Research ATV 2100 system from www.mypushcart.com 
                    for a very reasonable &pound;58 including what they call a 
                    DLS (basically 2 pre-wired relays to convert the standard 
                    NEGATIVE output to a POSITIVE output) and two additional relays 
                    - I'll explain what these were for and why I didn't use them 
                    later.</p>

                  <p>I wired in the pre-wired plug (that connects to the unit) 
                    first, before plugging it in.</p>
                  <p>On the unit itself:</p>
                  <p><b>&middot; RED - Constant 12v<br>
                    </b>I first crimped a forked terminal onto the RED wire. On 
                    my car, under the back seat (pulls up) on the RIGHT there 
                    was a black plastic housing (looks identical to the fuseable 
                    link box in the engine bay) with a big red wire going in and 
                    bolted to a big black wire going out. I carefully opened the 
                    plastic cover and loosened the nut - with a socket, making 
                    sure you don't touch any metal other than the nut! Then slide 
                    the crimped terminal under the nut and do the nut up again. 
                    I was careful not to break the connection made by the red 
                    wire incase it affected any of the cars systems.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    &middot; BLACK - to NEGATIVE / GROUND<br>
                    </b>Again, crimped a fork terminal on the wire first. On the 
                    metal 'wall' next to where the RED wire has just been connected, 
                    there should be a nut (probably with paint on). If you undo 
                    this you'll be able to slide the forked terminal in and do 
                    the nut up again. I measured this to check if it was a good 
                    ground, and it was fine, as the nut and the face it tightens 
                    onto are bare metal - no paint!</p>
                  <p><b>&middot; YELLOW - to switched 12v</b> (comes on when ignition 
                    is on)<br>
                    This was a bit trickier to find. On the LEFT of the space 
                    under the back seat is the central locking control unit and 
                    some orange relays. Using a small screwdriver you can release 
                    the little tab holding the 3 relays in place and lift them 
                    up a bit to inspect the wires going into them. I think that 
                    it was the middle of the 3 relays, but not sure, that has 
                    Purple/Black wire (looks a bit fatter than the others) going 
                    into it, which showed on the meter as going on and off with 
                    the ignition, so I opted for this one. By the LEFT corner 
                    you'll see a load of wires... find the Purple/Black fat one! 
                    Once I'd found it, I used a Scotch-lock (SL) (one of those 
                    plastic clips with a metal insert that you clamp over the 
                    two wires you want to connect) and just clamped it onto the 
                    wire so I could measure it again to check. Proved OK, so undid 
                    the SL and put the YELLOW wire in and clamped shut to connect 
                    them both.</p>
                  <p>I didn't use the GREY or ORANGE wires, so cut any exposed 
                    wire off them and then taped the ends with insulation tape.<br>

                    although for the OMEGA<br>
                    unit, it has a 3 pin red plug wired into it. The OMEGA (and 
                    so do many other, so check when you are buying) produces NEGATIVE 
                    pulses to lock/unlock the doors - but the BMW E34 needs POSITIVE 
                    pulses. I think this applies on most models, and also on the 
                    3 and 7 series&#133;but don't hold me to that! The DLS converts 
                    the negative pulses to positive pulses.</p>

                <td colspan="2">Right then, this was a pain&#133;coupled with 
                  the fact that the instruction booklet is not set out particularly 
                  well, having the worded description for the positive pulse wiring 
                  underneath the diagram for the negative pulse wiring&#133;.well, 
                  I blew one of the fuses by reading the words &amp; following 
                  the diagram! 
                  <p align="left">Here's the correct diagram (the 2 SPD relays 
                    are the 2 relays attached to the DLS!)</p>
                  <p align="center"><br>

                  </p>
                  <p>1. Open the boot (or 'trunk' if you prefer!) and undo the 
                    4 plastic screws (each move a &frac14; of a turn) on the trim 
                    on the boot lid itself. Unhook it over the rubber bump stops 
                    and pull it dow so you can see the lock mechanism and wires 
                    and bits. Make a note of where the solenoid is before you 
                    undo it, as the position is important for it to work properly. 
                    The solenoid is held in place by 2 brass looking bolts (about 
                    6 or 8 mm) - you should be able to see the near the black 
                    latch on the inside of the boot lid. By the key lock barrel 
                    (on the inside) you will see a bar with a 900 bend the end 
                    that sits in a plastic bush - this bar is attached to the 
                    solenoid and you need to push the bar out of the bush before 
                    the solenoid will come out. Undo the two nuts and remove the 
                    solenoid, leaving the wires plugged into it! It's a bit of 
                    a fiddle, and is easier if you take the connecting bar out 
                    of the solenoid end as well.</p>
                  <p>2. With the solenoid out, you can open the top of the connecting 
                    plug to reveal the wires, which convieniently have round holes 
                    in to poke the meter into! By locking and unlocking (pull 
                    and push on the solenoid you've just got out) you can measure 
                    the voltages on the 5 pins exposed. Here's what I found:</p>
                  <p>RED/BLACK +12v all the time<br>
                    WHITE +12v pulse when locked, then 0v at rest in locked position.<br>
                    WHITE/GREEN +12v when unlocked / 0v when locked / 12v when 
                    actuator at rest unlocked<br>
                    BLUE +12v Pulse when unlocked / 0v when at rest in unlocked 
                    position<br>
                    WHITE/BLUE +12v when locked / 0v when unlocked / +12v when 
                    actuator at rest locked</p>
                  <p><b>When DEADLOCKED with the key:</b></p>
                  <p>&middot; All 0v except WHITE/BLUE and RED/BLACK, which showed 
                    +12v<br>
                    <br>
                    The two additional relays (not the DLS) that I mentioned I 
                    didn't use, are for if you want to protect the solenoids from 
                    damage that can occur if the door are deadlocked with the 
                    key, then tried to unlock by the remote. I didn't do this, 
                    as the deadlocking had ben playing up and I didn't want to 
                    use it anymore. If you don't install these relays just remember 
                    when you've deadlocked the car! www.mypushcart.com can e-mail 
                    you the diagrams if you want to fit them.</p>
                  <p>All the wires go back to the load of wires by the central 
                    locking control unit, and it will help matters if you can 
                    get some of the tape off to make it easier to separate the 
                    wires.</p>
                  <p>This is how I wired it up (again, using Scotch-locks), and 
                    everything is working fine:</p>

                  <p>I did the testing the wires with the SL crimped on first, 
                    before connecting the wires&#133;..just to be certain!</p>
                  <p>Once everything was plugged in, I programmed the unit as 
                    per the instructions supplied.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Finishing Off:<br>
                    </b>The DLS relays I mounted on one of the screws on the central 
                    locking control plastic cover. One screw is easily accessible 
                    and is nearest the back of the seat&#133;you can't miss it. 
                    I took this scerw out, put the DLS relays in between the 2 
                    halves of the plastic cover and lined up the hole in the relay 
                    with the screw hole, then put the screw back in to clamp it 
                    in place. The relays are really light, so I figured this should 
                    be ok.</p>
                  <p>The main unit itself has two mouting tabs with holes in. 
                    Just above where I connected the black GROUND wire, there 
                    is a threaded bolt hole - I found a bolt with the same thread 
                    and fastened the unit to the metal 'wall' securely. Again, 
                    it is not heavy at all and was held very firmly in place.</p>
                  <p>The aerial wire. I pulled off the rubber/felt trim around 
                    the door frame and then fed the wire into it and pushed it 
                    back in place, so the wire ended up sealed in around the door 
                    frame - which gave quite good reception and was nicely out 
                    of the way.<br>
                    Things to Note:</p>
                  <p>The system CAN operate the full closure system should your 
                    E34 have it (normally operated by holding the key in the lock 
                    or deadlock position). When the system is wired as described 
                    above, the full closure will not work. The reason for this 
                    ( I think) is that the boot (trunk) lock doesn't operate the 
                    full closure when using the key - hence as the system is wired 
                    up off this set of wires, the full closure won't work. If 
                    you can be bothered to try and figure out the lock/unlock 
                    wires from in the drivers or passenger doors, I guess it should 
                    work. I just decided that it would be considerably easier 
                    to use the boot lock wires, and also I quite like to leave 
                    he sunroof or windows slightly open in the summer when locking 
                    the car up.</p>

                <td colspan="2"><font size="2">All,<br>
                  I installed my keyless entry system last night. I thought I'd 
                  pass on what I learned in the process. It's cheap, easy, and 
                  quick if you know what you're doing. First, all E34's have positive 
                  trigger or output for the door locks! Many other cars have negative 
                  trigger. So, you need a keyless system that can do positive 
                  trigger or you need to buy a few extra parts to turn the negative 
                  trigger system into a positive trigger. I bought my keyless 
                  entry system from www.mypushcart.com. It was the Crimestopper 
                  845RKE. It cost $40 including priority mail delivery. But, it 
                  doesn't have positive trigger. So, I had to also buy two 30 
                  amp relays and the prewired sockets for them. I bought the relays 
                  and sockets from a local car stereo and alarm place for $7.50 
                  total. You can also go to a place like www.audio-etcetera.com 
                  and buy two 30 amp relays (CRI-CS-402A, $1.66 each) and two 
                  prewired sockets (CRI-CS-SRS, $0.96 each). It's easy to wire 
                  in the relays - the manual that comes from Crimestopper shows 
                  you how. If you can follow a map, then you can wire this in. 
                  Crimestopper also makes a model 855RKE that has the positive 
                  trigger built in (other manufacturers also have them). I could 
                  have bought that and saved myself a little grief but I didn't 
                  know I needed positive trigger. </font> 
                  <p><font size="2">Basically, when installing the system, you 
                    need to find a ground, a constant +12 volts, the lock wire 
                    and the unlock wire. If you want your locks to lock when you 
                    start your car and unlock when you shut it off, then you also 
                    need to find a +12 volts that comes on when the engine is 
                    running. I didn't wire mine up to chirp the horn or flash 
                    the lights so I can't help you there. It also pays to buy 
                    some low voltage tap-ins. I got a package of them from Radio 
                    Shack (#64-3053) for $1.69. They allow you to crimp your keyless 
                    entry wire onto the existing wire rather than cutting into 
                    the wire and soldering. You just squeeze them on with a plier. 
                    I've had good luck with them.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2">Disclaimer: What follows is my take on things. 
                    I am not an engineer. Don&#146;t hold me responsible if you 
                    blow a fuse or something. I&#146;ve been as careful as possible, 
                    but verify what I&#146;ve written by looking at your own Bentley 
                    manual or by talking to a pro or another person who&#146;s 
                    done this. End of disclaimer. For '92, &#146;93, and '95 E34's, 
                    the system installs under the back seat on the passenger side. 
                    Look for the 12-pin plug near the battery where the alarm 
                    module would plug in. The lock wire is white/red/yellow dots. 
                    The unlock is blue/red/yellow dots. The brown/orange wire 
                    is the ground, the red/gray wire is the constant +12 volts, 
                    and the violet/white wire is the one that is +12 volts when 
                    the car is running. 1994 E34&#146;s are the same as above 
                    except the constant +12 volts is yellow wire on the alarm 
                    plug and the ground is brown. Sorry, but my Bentley&#146;s 
                    doesn&#146;t show which wire is the +12 volts when the car 
                    is running. </font></p>
                  <p><font size="2">For '89 through '91 E34's, the system installs 
                    in the kick panel near the driver's left foot. The lock wire 
                    is white/red/yellow dots. The unlock is blue/brown/yellow 
                    dots. You should be able to find a red wire for the constant 
                    +12 volts (here&#146;s when a cheap multimeter is handy) and 
                    a small screw or something for the ground. I don&#146;t know 
                    where to find the +12 volts that is hot only when the engine 
                    is running.</font></p>
                  <p><font size="2">The systems usually come with an LED that 
                    blinks to help you program the system and it blinks when the 
                    car is locked. I figured it may serve as a theft deterrent 
                    so I installed it in the plastic panel that is behind the 
                    right calf of a passenger sitting in the back seat on the 
                    opposite side of the car from the driver. I led the programming 
                    push button up behind the seat so it is behind the center 
                    armrest in the back seat, behind the cover that's held up 
                    with Velcro, and even behind a small flap in the rubber sound-deadening 
                    material (my car doesn't have the ski boot). I didn't want 
                    to have to pull up the back seat to re-program the remotes 
                    or the system.</font></p>

                  <p>Double-locking (at least in my '92 525i) is triggered by 
                    sending 12V to both the lock and unlock wires at the same 
                    time. All you need to do to enable double-locking is to solder 
                    a diode between those two wires. A cheap 1n5401 (available 
                    at Radio Shack) will do the job just fine. Solder the end 
                    of the diode with the solid line on it to the unlock wire, 
                    and the other end to the lock wire. The diode lets the voltage 
                    go to both wires when locking, and only the unlock wire when 
                    unlocking. It works by letting current flow through the diode 
                    from the lock wire to the unlock side during the lock process. 
                    Then it blocks the current to the lock wire when the unlock 
                    wire receives power. If it works backwards, then change the 
                    orientation of the diode.</p>
                  <p>I have an alarm system that I bought from my local electronics 
                    wholesaler for about $60. It has most of the features of the 
                    big name alarms like code jumping, lock when the ignition 
                    is turned/unlock with key off, flashing lights, dual-level 
                    aux input, etc. The cool thing is that when the doors lock 
                    when I start my car, they don't double-lock -- there must 
                    be some logic in BMW brain somewhere that prevents the car 
                    from double-locking with the key is in the ignition.</p>

                  <p>Here's what I came up with. This should apply to '92/'93/'95 
                    E34's. Like Chris said, if you explode your car or something, 
                    it's your own damn fault :)</p>
                  <p>Please note that it's entirely possible that my cause and 
                    effect is faulty. This is just what I traced down using a 
                    trusty test light. BTW, a test light like mine is handy for 
                    this kind of work. It's one of the ones that looks like a 
                    screw driver with an alligator-clip wire emanating from the 
                    top. The real secret is that it eliminates those pesky short 
                    circuits because it just lights up if you are connecting opposite 
                    polarities. If you alternately hook the alligator clip to 
                    positive or negative, then you can probe for triggers because 
                    the bulb's filament completes the circuit, and the trigger 
                    circuits don't even pull enough current to light it up. This 
                    obviously isn't a good idea where sensitive/high-impedance 
                    drivers are involved, i.e., fuel injector circuits in some 
                    cars or airbag wiring; in those cases, dig out the DMM. <br>

                  <p>In my case, I have a DEI keyless entry that came with all 
                    kinds of goodies I probably won't use. I will mention some 
                    of the features I did use, and how. The great thing is that 
                    you don't have to go anywhere except the plug under the rear 
                    seat. I'm pretty anal retentive and solder in everything instead 
                    of using taps; even so, the actual installation only took 
                    about 30 minutes. <br>
                    <br>
                    1. Unlike some systems, this one supplies both positive and 
                    negative signals for lock/unlock. Unfortunately, this isn't 
                    done with four separate wires, but with two. How? Each wire 
                    does double-duty, carrying the inverse of what the other does; 
                    for example, one wire is + lock, - unlock. The other is the 
                    opposite. This causes a bit of a problem when trying to do 
                    the double-lock action, since a single diode would still cause 
                    a short circuit between the + of the lock circuit and the 
                    - of the unlock (remember the other is always inverted). While 
                    DEI might have put in circuitry to eliminate this problem, 
                    I wasn't taking chances, so I used two diodes to eliminate 
                    the possibility of + current going &quot;back up&quot; the 
                    unlock wire (see lower circuit in diagram). This might not 
                    be a bad idea even if your unit doesn't reverse polarities, 
                    as the driver might still be sensitive to the onrush of current. 
                    Thus far, we have lock and double-lock (whoo-hooo). <br>
                    <br>
                    2. ...But we don't have window/sunroof rollup. That's because 
                    my keyless unit only supplies a pulse for lock, not a constant 
                    signal. This can be overcome (apparently) with add-on units 
                    that DEI supplies, but I don't have no stinking time to wait 
                    around ;) To add insult to injury, you can't program this 
                    system to perform more than one channel function for the same 
                    key (separate channels are controlled by either separate buttons 
                    or unique combinations of two buttons pressed simultaneously). 
                    I reasoned that it wouldn't be a *bad* use of the auxiliary 
                    button to perform the rollup feature. The auxiliary channel 
                    supplies a (-) signal as long as the button is pressed. As 
                    a side note, I also couldn't just reprogram the auxiliary 
                    channel to the lock button, because the unit needs a &quot;proper&quot; 
                    lock signal to perform all the housekeeping it does (start 
                    blinking the LED, flash lights, honk horn, whatever). First 
                    the (-) signal was converted to (+) using a relay. Then a 
                    couple more diodes were utilized to merge the unlock and aux 
                    signals without screwing something up (upper diagram). BTW, 
                    I happened to have about 20 of these diodes around, I bought 
                    a pack of 25 a while back for another project :) So now, you 
                    lock with the lock button, then press the aux button to roll 
                    up the windows, etc. I'm not sure what the current draw would 
                    do to an alarm system, though. It might think things are locked 
                    up and something is malevolently using electricity. <br>
                    <br>
                    3. All the other DEI channels are (-) trigger, so I plugged 
                    them straight in to the dome light and parking light wires. 
                    I could have triggered the domes on unlock from the lock wire 
                    (remember that inversion thing?), but decided to use the &quot;progressive 
                    unlock&quot; channel. This is normally used to unlock the 
                    driver's door on the first press of the unlock, and the rest 
                    of the doors on the second press. Now I can control whether 
                    the domes come on before the door is opened, by pressing the 
                    unlock a second time. <br>
                    <br>
                    4. It's not horny :) Even though I'm sure the factory system 
                    has horn blip confirmation, I couldn't find a wire from the 
                    rear of the car to perform this function. Even if it did, 
                    the horn relay only gets its constant + when the key is on 
                    (the horn button supplies the -). Actually, supplying the 
                    horn relay wire with a + positive signal when the car is off 
                    will honk the horn. I don't know if this is by design or if 
                    the other side of the relay is grounding through the windings 
                    or filaments of other items in the same power circuit. Don't 
                    laugh, the a/c relay on my Triumph is wired that way on purpose. 
                    Since I was putting the lower dash back together, I tapped 
                    into the relay wire and stowed a bundle under the carpet panel 
                    next to the console, for future use without taking everything 
                    apart. <br>
                    <br>
                    5. I took advantage of the opportunity to wire in a few other 
                    indulgences. These are items that it would be foolish to post 
                    on the World Wide Web! Let's just say that I made thieve's 
                    lives a little harder. </p>
