                  <p>One way to give a little bit more air to the Bmw E34 engine 
                    is to change the air filter to a less restrictive one like 
                    K&amp;N or by removing the filter box and replacing it with 
                    a cool air induction filter (more expensive).</p>
                  <p><b>Pros</b>: If you have a sport exhaust, the sound will 
                    be deeper. Maybe a little increase of acceleration. It is 
                    the last time that you'll buy an air filter (if you clean 
                    and oil it).</p>
                  <p><b>Cons</b>: I must warn you that some people think that 
                    the K&amp;N type filters do not filter the air as good as 
                    the stock filter and might harm your engine.<br>
                    Cold air intakes non insulated are getting the warm air of 
                    the engine. This will <b><font color="#990000">LOWER</font></b> 
                    your HP.</p>
                  <p><br>
                    <b>Rob Levinson from UUC Motorwerks</b> says that &quot;it 
                    is really doing every E34 owner a disservice for three reasons:<br>
                    &#149; First, conclusive tests from independent labs show 
                    that K&N filters, no matter how well-oiled and cleaned, let 
                    through huge amounts of large particulate that damages engines. 
                    Oil analysis shows 5x as much silicate contamination. Additionally, 
                    the oil from these filters tends to muck up the MAF and cause 
                    an engine-damaging lean-run condition. <br>
                    &#149; Second, an open element filter like that sucks in hot 
                    underhood air and subjects the filter to "fan wash", the swirl 
                    that creates a vacuum effect. On the E36 M3, we measure a 
                    15hp loss from open cone filters. <br>
                    &#149; Third, the E34 airbox is designed with an integral 
                    velocity-stack style venturi at the opening. Running one of 
                    these engines on a dyno, you can cause a 5hp drop just from 
                    putting your finger on the stack lip. Removing that airbox 
                    undoes a lot of good BMW engineering. Yes, these filters make 
                    a "really cool" noise... but <b><font color="#990000">noise 
                    does not equal power</font></b>. Stick with a stock paper 
                    element in the factory airbox, you're not getting any more 
                    power with a K&N garbage-filter, just damaging your motor.&quot;</p>
                  <p><b>Jim Conforti (AKA the Land Shark) did some testing</b>:<br>
                    This was a scientific test, not one done by filter manufacturer 
                    X to show that their filters are better than manufacturer 
                    Y. The test results are pretty irrefutable as the test lab 
                    tests and designs filters where "screw ups" are absolutely 
                    NOT allowable (I can't say any more for security. Think "Glow 
                    in the Dark").</p>
                  <p>A scientific test was done on TEST filters where air was 
                    loaded with ACCTD (some standardized "test dust" called AC 
                    Coarse Test Dust) and sucked through the TEST filter then 
                    through an analysis membrane. From the Quantity of dust injected 
                    and the amount that gets through the TEST filter and is then 
                    captured on the analysis membrane we can calculate the efficiency 
                    of the TEST filter in Question.</p>
                  <p>BMW Stock Filter, Eff. Area of Media: 8.4 sq ft. <br>
                    K&N Replacement, Eff. Area of Media: 1.6 sq ft. </p>
                  <p>The filters are the SAME size.&nbsp; They both fit in the 
                    STOCK BMW M3 airbox.&nbsp; The difference is that the STOCK 
                    filter has 65 pleats 1.5&quot; deep and the K&amp;N only 29 
                    pleats each 0.75&quot; deep. <br>
                    Now, remember this ratio: &quot; 5.25:1&quot;.&nbsp; It's 
                    the ratio of the AREA of STOCK to K&amp;N.&nbsp; It's very 
                    important and will come into play later. </p>
                  <p>The STOCK filter efficiency started at 93.4% at 0 loading 
                    and increased to 99.2% efficiency as the loading increased 
                    to a max tested of 38.8 gm/sq ft of dust. <br>
                  <p>The K&amp;N filter efficiency started at 85.2% at 0 loading 
                    and increased to 98.1% at the max tested loading of 41.38 
                    gm/sq ft. 
                  <p>Now, I hear you. &quot;Jim, that's only a FEW PERCENT&quot;.&nbsp; 
                    But is it? 
                  <p>Let's look.&nbsp; If we had 100 grams of dust on a new BMW 
                    filter we would let through a total of 6.6 grams of dust in.&nbsp; 
                    If we used the new K&amp;N filter we get 14.8 grams of dust.&nbsp; 
                    That's 224% (TWO HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR PERCENT!!) more dust 
                    ingested initially, stock vs. &quot;free flow&quot; and this 
                    ratio is pretty much held.&nbsp; Somewhere between 200-300% 
                    more dirt gets &quot;ingested&quot; anywhere across loading 
                    equivalence. The more INTERESTING thing is when you look at 
                    what happens to the DP or Differential Pressure at a constant 
                    airflow as you dirty both filters equally with time. 
                  <p>The test used a rate of 75gr of dust per 20 min.&nbsp; Here's 
                    where the AREA difference comes MAJORLY into play.&nbsp; See, 
                    even though the BMW filter flows a bit less at the SAME loading, 
                    it also LOADS UP 5.25 times SLOWER due to it's LARGER effective 
                    area.&nbsp; So what happens is that the K&amp;N initially 
                    flows better, but as the dirt continues coming in, the K&amp;N 
                    eventually flows WORSE while still letting MORE dirt in. 
                  <p>Now, does any of this additional dirt cause problems?&nbsp; 
                    I dunno. I suppose we could have a few people do some independent 
                    oil analyses on different motors using both K&amp;Ns and Stock 
                    filters.&nbsp; Get enough of them, and you'd have a good statistical 
                    basis.&nbsp; For me though, it's simple: More DIRT = BAD. 
                  <p>The additional short-term airflow might make sense on a track 
                    car.&nbsp; IMHO, it doesn't for the street.</p>

                  <p>It is incorrect. The difference between 99.2% and 98.1% (his 
                    results) is 1.1% not 224% as he states!!! <b><font color="#990000">(bmwE34.net: 
                    who didn't go to school, Jim was measuring the amount of dust 
                    that goes inside the engine). </font></b>Furthermore, does 
                    he realize that 96% meets OEM standards? K&amp;N has been 
                    around for over 30 years and we sell over 2,000,000 units 
                    a year. If there were any sort of problem, one would think 
                    we would know by now and so would everyone else. One Internet 
                    &quot;expert's&quot; opinion is not reason for concern and 
                    should be taken loosely at best.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    </b>That information is 100% untrue. Don't believe all you 
                    read on the Net. Most is opinions not based on any sort of 
                    factual evidence. Our filters are tested by an outside, independent 
                    laboratory. They have been proven to stop at least 99% of 
                    particles on a SAE dust test. This test uses particles as 
                    low as the 0 - 5 micron range and goes up to 20 microns.<br>
                    For comparison, a paper filter also stops 99% on the same 
                    test and the OEM minimum standard is 96%. Foam is generally 
                    the worst media with a typical efficiency rating of 75 - 85%. 
                    To get higher ratings, the foam must be more dense and therefore 
                    way more restrictive. The &quot;tack&quot; characteristic 
                    of a K&amp;N allows for increase filtration without loss of 
                    flow as well. The testing procedure used is SAE J-726 using 
                    ISO Test Dust.<br>
                    This test is the standard of the air filter industry. The 
                    test procedure consists of flowing air through the filter 
                    at a constant rate (airflow rate is determined by the application) 
                    while feeding test dust into the air stream at a rate of 1 
                    gram per cubic meter of air.<br>
                    As the filter loads with dust the pressure drop across the<br>
                    filter is increased to maintain the prescribed airflow rate. 
                    The test is continued until the pressure drop increases 10&quot; 
                    H2O above the initial restriction of the clean element (in 
                    this case .78&quot; to 10.78&quot; H2O). At this point the 
                    test is terminated. The dirty filter element is then weighed. 
                    This weight is compared to the clean element weight to determine 
                    the total Dust<br>
                    Capacity. The amount of dust retained by the filter is divided 
                    by the total amount of dust fed during the test to determine 
                    the Cumulative Efficiency. 
                  <p>The K&amp;N filter achieved the following results:<br>
                    - Dust Capacity: 305grams<br>
                    - K&amp;N Cumulative Efficiency: 99.05 %<br>
                    <br>
                    Holding the filter to the light is useless, pin holes are 
                    normal.<br>
                    That is what makes a K&amp;N filter. There are actually hundreds 
                    of microscopic fibers that cross these holes and when treated 
                    with oil, capture and hold the very fine particles. On the 
                    same hand, they allow the filter to flow more air than paper 
                    or foam. The filter is 4 ply cotton gauze unlike some competitors 
                    synthetic material filters. The synthetics do not<br>
                    have the very small fibers that natural cotton does. Also, 
                    the oil can be pulled off of a foam filter contaminating electronic 
                    sensors. It will absorb into cotton and stay in the media. 
                    In fact, Honda and Toyota only recommend K&amp;N filters when 
                    using aftermarket high flow filters as K&amp;N is the only 
                    brand of filter the oil does NOT come off of. They will not 
                    cover a failed sensor if foam filters were used.<br>
                    We got started over 30 years ago making filters for motorcycles 
                    and off road racers. The filters did so well that these guys 
                    wanted them for their cars and trucks. We started making filters 
                    for these applications and here we are today. If they did 
                    not work, we would not still be here and growing every year.<br>
                    We now make filters for Chrysler/Mopar, Ford Motorsports, 
                    Edelbrock, Rotax Engines, and Harley Davidson. We come as 
                    original equipment on the 2000 Ford Mustang Cobra-R. We even 
                    made filters for the Apache helicopters used in Desert Storm 
                    because of maintenance problems with the original paper design. 
                    If they work in these conditions they will work for you.
