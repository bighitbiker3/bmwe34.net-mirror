                  <p>If your BMW E34 came from the factory with either an analogue 
                    clock or a digital clock/outside temperature combo it is possible 
                    to upgrade to the full On Board Computer (OBC). The clock 
                    units use the same connector as the OBC and all the wiring 
                    is already in place.</p>
                  <p>Cars that had only an analogue clock do not have the outside 
                    temperature sensor mounted, so this function will not work, 
                    but all the other signals come from the ECU.<br>
                    Cars that have the instrument cluster with no check control 
                    will most likely have no gong so the OBC will stay quiet about 
                    ice and speed limit warnings and give a visual warning only.<br>
                    All other functions should work as expected - including the 
                    CODE start blocking!</p>

                  <p>The first step is to find an OBC unit - These can be got 
                    from the stealer (P/N 65 81 8 351 055) but are big $$$ so 
                    the best bet is to find a used one from a breaker's yard or 
                    similar. An OBC from any BMW E34 model will do - even a BMW 
                    E32 OBC will work but as the 7 series has a bigger petrol 
                    tank some calculations such as 'range' may be incorrect. Other 
                    parts you may want to get are the turn-signal switch which 
                    has the OBC remote control on the tip and the new radio/OBC 
                    holder. The OBC will work fine without installing the new 
                    turn-signal switch and will still blend its notifications 
                    into the check control display. The mounting frame (holds 
                    together the clock or OBC as well as the radio and heater 
                    control module) differs for OBC vs clock equipped cars as 
                    the slot for the OBC is deeper than that for the clock, the 
                    OBC is approx. double the depth of the clock and the connector 
                    is located higher than on the clock. It is possible to cut 
                    away the plastic at the back of where the clock sat to allow 
                    the OBC fit but the ideal way is to replace the mounting frame. 
                    The part numbers for the two frames are: <br>
                    Holder radio/OBC 65 81 1 384 121<br>
                    Holder radio/clock 65 81 1 384 141</p>
                  <p><b>Note from David, modified by <a href="mailto:%20paul.l.durham@baesystems.com">Durham, 
                    Paul L</a> (UK):</b></p>
                  <p>The e34's have 2 different types of OBC one for the BMW 518i,520i 
                    and a different type for the BMW 525i,530i,535i,540i.<br>
                    There are two types of OBC but you can fit ANY OBC IV (without 
                    the coding plug socket) into a 518 or 520 with a little modification.<br>
                    I successfully retro-fitted an OBC IV (with GONG and Temp 
                    Sensor) into my 1995 520SEi where the OBC DID NOT have the 
                    coding plug socket in it and it's fully operational.<br>
                    All the OBC IV's out of higher spec cars eg.525, 535, etc 
                    (without coding plug socket's) are technically dumb on their 
                    own as they have no information about the car's engine type, 
                    etc.<br>
                    This means you go to BMW (like i did) and buy a coding plug 
                    for &pound;20 (UK). <br>
                    BMW need to know Year, Model, Petrol or Deisel, Plastic or 
                    Metal Fuel Tank so that the coding plug has the correct calculation's 
                    for your engine, eg. MPG,etc.<br>
                    You then take the coding plug apart so your left with a mini 
                    PCB. You then open your OBC and solder the mini PCB onto the 
                    back of your OBC. It's only 6 pins and is super easy to do.</p>
                  <p>Your OBC will now know what your car is (<b>NO PPPP ERROR</b>) 
                    !<br>
                    The info on how to do this is in this PDF File here : http://gunnar525.de/schraubereien/bc4_umbau_codierstecker.pdf<br>
                    It's in German but the pics are easy to follow.<br>
                    Once you get past this stage you can then carry on with the 
                    retro-fit.<br>

                  <p>Second step is to remove your old clock - To do this, remove 
                    the radio and the radio's mounting case and then reach inside 
                    the vacant radio slot at the side next to the clock, at the 
                    top you should feel a little lever (position marked by red 
                    dot on remove_clock.jpg) which you need to press (push it 
                    towards the engine) and the mechanism should make the clock 
                    move out towards you and you can then pull it out the rest 
                    of the way with your fingers. <br>
                    The third step is to try the OBC to see if it works - The 
                    connector is clipped into the back of the mounting frame, 
                    unclip this and pull it out a bit (there should be an inch 
                    or two give in the wiring) and then plug it into the back 
                    of the OBC. Turn the ignition on and see if the OBC comes 
                    to life. </p>

                    Clock removed</p>
                  <p>If the OBC doesn't come up the next step is to figure out 
                    why. The list of connections is given in the table below so 
                    start by checking that there is +12v at pins 6, 8, 9 &amp; 
                    17. The most likely culprit is pin 17 as there will be no 
                    power to this if your car doesn't have the auxiliary horn 
                    relay installed and without power at pin 17 the OBC will play 
                    completely dead. If there is no power at pin 17 an easy solution 
                    is to cut the red-grey-yellow wire that goes to pin 17, cut 
                    it as far from the connector as possible to make life easier, 
                    and join this to the red-yellow (red with a yellow stripe, 
                    there's also a yellow wire with a red stripe!) wire that provides 
                    power to pin 9. You could join these via a 5 or 10 amp fuse 
                    if you prefer and it may be no harm to tape off the end of 
                    the red-grey-yellow wire coming from the car so it can't cause 
                    any problems. </p>

                  <p>Once the OBC is working, the next step is make it fit properly 
                    - You can either replace the mounting frame with the one designed 
                    to hold the OBC or alternatively you can cut away the plastic 
                    at the back of the original mounting frame (This can even 
                    be done without removing the mounting frame if you are careful 
                    by using a suitable saw from the front) so that the OBC will 
                    slide in all the way until the front of it is flush with the 
                    console.</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="Data/OBCopen.jpg" width="292" height="114"></p>
                  <p>Next, you need to set the country setting for language, miles/km, 
                    C/F and l/100Km / Km/l. - To do this you need to access the 
                    OBC test menu by simultaneously pressing the 1000 and 10 keys 
                    so that the display changes to &quot;TEST&quot;. With the 
                    10 &amp; 1 keys enter 11 on the display and then press the 
                    S/R button. &quot;0 LAND&quot; should now be on the display 
                    and you can alter this by using the 1000 &amp; 100 keys and 
                    the S/R to save. The settings are from &quot;0 LAND&quot; 
                    to &quot;9 LAND&quot; and through trial and error you should 
                    be able to find the setting that is best for you. Also, some 
                    settings use US gallons while others use European gallons 
                    so take that into account.</p>
                  <p>If the OBC appears to be reporting inaccurate fuel consumption 
                    figures it can be calibrated to give the correct values. - 
                    Fill the fuel tank to the maximum and reset the trip counter 
                    and one of the OBC's average fuel consumption monitors. Run 
                    the fuel tank nearly empty and fill the fuel tank again to 
                    the maximum. The amount of fuel it now takes to fill the tank 
                    is the amount used to cover the distance recorded on the trip 
                    meter so, from this, work out the actual fuel consumption 
                    of the car and then compare this to what the OBC reported 
                    as the average fuel consumption. If these two average fuel 
                    consumption figures are not exactly the same then you need 
                    to calibrate the OBC by entering a new correction factor. 
                    <br>
                    The fuel consumption correction factor is a locked function 
                    of the OBC so before you can access it, you must first unlock 
                    the OBC - Access the OBC test menu by simultaneously pressing 
                    the 1000 and 10 keys so that the display changes to &quot;TEST&quot;. 
                    With the 10 &amp; 1 keys enter 19 on the display and then 
                    press the S/R button. Add the current day and month (as it 
                    is known to the OBC) and enter this value and then press the 
                    S/R button, the OBC should now be unlocked. To access the 
                    fuel consumption calibration factor you once more need to 
                    simultaneously press the 1000 and 10 keys so that the display 
                    changes to &quot;TEST&quot;. With the 10 &amp; 1 keys enter 
                    20 (Be careful not to enter 21 as this will reset the OBC) 
                    on the display and then press the S/R button - you should 
                    now see something like 1000 CORR, this is your current correction 
                    factor. To calculate your new correction factor use the following:</p>
                  <p>new_correction_factor = old_correction_factor * actual_mpg 
                    / obc_mpg</p>
                  <p>Enter your new correction factor into the OBC using the 1000/100/10/1 
                    keys and then press the S/R button. If you want to relock 
                    the OBC - enter function 19 again then press the C/F button 
                    to lock.</p>

                  <p><b><font size="3">More info from Mark about temperature sensor:</font></b></p>
                  <p>I have a 1990 E34 525iA SE (UK spec) that was originally 
                    fitted with an analogue clock. Following your instructions 
                    I removed the clock and fitted a used OBC. This worked fine, 
                    but had the annoying problem of sounding the gong every time 
                    the ignition was switched on due to the external temperature 
                    sensor not being fitted. </p>
                  <p>Well, after a while this just because too much, to after 
                    some investigation I found that the wiring harness for the 
                    temperature sensor was indeed fitted to the car. It was located 
                    behind the radiator in the same place where the horn is mounted, 
                    i.e. in the centre of the car, behind the grill in between 
                    the lights. The wiring harness was coiled up and clipped out 
                    of the way. Once I had released the clip, it was then just 
                    a simple case of plugging in my new temperature sensor to 
                    the harness and it worked first time. I did try to route the 
                    sensor somewhere away from the radiator so it would measure 
                    the<br>
                    external temperature, not the radiator temperature ! </p>
                  <p>The only trick that the old girl had left was that it seems 
                    to take a few hours for the OBC to register the correct temperature. 
                    It crept slowly up from -39oC to the correct outside temperature. 
                    I'm assuming that there must be some kind of digital or analogue 
                    filter on the system that has a very large time constant. 
                    Anyway, once it had reached correct temperature it seems to 
                    operate correctly, agreeing with roadside temperature signs.</p>
                  <p><b>More temperature sensor from Mark A.</b><br>
                    I finally got bored with the display telling me it was -34 
                    outside, so I ordered the temp sensor from BMW main dealer 
                    for only 17 pounds UK.</p>
                  <p>Took the front off the car &amp; spent hours searching for 
                    the magic wire to connect it up. Needless to say, it wasn't 
                    there. It would seem that mine (94 525 European spec) didn't 
                    have it fitted. The solution is to run a wire from one side 
                    of the sensor to earth (ground) &amp; the other one thru the 
                    car &amp; splice it in to pin 5. All now works ok.<br>
                    Just thought this may be useful to anyone else doing the retrofit 
                    &amp; thinking they're going mad as the cant find the missing 
                    wire.</p>
                  <p><b>More info from Andy:</b><br>
                    The OBC will chime every time you turn on the ignition and 
                    give you a -34 degrees warning if you don't have or fit a 
                    temperature sensor. I thought mine had a fault until I searched 
                    a few sites. </p>

                    it is not possible. </b></p>
                  <p><b>More info from Tom Bosman:</b><br>
                    Having just retrofitted an OBC to an 89 525i (thanks to your 
                    notes) I would like to pass on a little additional info re 
                    a problem I encountered.</p>
                  <p>As part of the retrofit I also purchased an indicator stalk 
                    (turn signal) with switch. When I pulled the old one out and 
                    compared it with the new one there were a few differences 
                    (besides the extra wires for switch). The old switch had a 
                    relay attached to the 12 pin plug which strangely had no output. 
                    One of the wires of this relay was on the same pin as the 
                    yellow/red wire on the new switch which operates the dash 
                    display from OBC. After trying the switch as is and it not 
                    working I then wired it up the same as the old switch and 
                    then had a yellow/red wire floating free. After some further 
                    investigation I discovered another connector under the socket 
                    for indicator stalk connection which had a yellow/red. I traced 
                    this wire back to pin 25 of OBC which is the trigger for dash 
                    display. After connecting my spare yellow/red to this the 
                    dash display now worked. I also discovered that the relay 
                    with no output was merely connected to the flasher to make 
                    it audible. Without the relay the flashers worked perfectly 
                    but were silent. Hope this can be of help to some others who 
                    have trouble with indicator stalk switch.<br>
