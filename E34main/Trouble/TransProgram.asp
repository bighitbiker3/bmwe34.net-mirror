                  <p>Things to check before even contemplating a transmission 
                    overhaul:<br>
                    Check electrics - Alternator and battery.<br>
                    Replace DME Relay and Fuel Pump Relay - not expensive.<br>
                    Remove disassemble, clean and reassemble gear selector switch 
                    - If it looks beyond saving, replace ($200)<br>
                    Service the transmission ($130 from a specialist) and check/replace 
                    transmission speed sensor ($90)</p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="Data/PulseSensor.gif" width="510" height="378"><br>
                    Transmission speed sensor (Thanks to Doornbos, Trevor)</p>
                  <p>The above saved my bacon and a recommended $3,000 transmission 
                    rebuild.</p>
                  <p>My story (long) is below:<br>
                    <br>
                    So you've finally bought an E34 (1989 535i) privately (you 
                    can't trust the car sharks) with an excellent maintenance 
                    record (receipts and everything).<br>
                    Six cylinders of smooth power to push you effortlessly through 
                    the S-bends on your favourite road. A stab at the throttle 
                    and the tranny chops down for an extra surge of power to push 
                    you through the corner. Then it happens. &quot;BOOM&quot; 
                    from the tranny, &quot;BING&quot; from the dash. The tranny 
                    is now locked in limp mode which means that you're stuck in 
                    3rd gear which isn't always the best gear to power out of 
                    a good flowing corner. You look down at the dash readout to 
                    see &quot;TRANS PROGRAM Consult Owners Handbook&quot;. The 
                    good news is that you are a pretty experienced driver which 
                    means that you didn't end up over the hard shoulder and down 
                    in the creek with the eels.<br>
                    The Owners Handbook. A positive wealth of information (not). 
                    &quot;TRANS PROGRAM&quot; to find the manual states &quot;Take 
                    the car to your dealer&quot;. Now I ask you, if these Germans 
                    are so clever, why can't they just say &quot;TRANS PROGRAM 
                    - Take Car to dealer&quot;.</p>
                  <p>That was the 3rd week of owning the car. What followed was 
                    amusing, at least in retrospect.<br>
                    Over a period of 4-6 weeks I consulted 2 BMW dealers (service) 
                    in person, an auto electrician in person, 3 mechanics over 
                    the phone, 1 mechanic to analyse the problem, and 1 Transmission 
                    shop to do the work.</p>
                  <p>Initially I was in the dark, until I happened across the 
                    BMW E34 web forums. I'm in Sydney Australia, so was keen to 
                    make local contact. After some trial and error I made some 
                    local contact and was recommend to this site. Hoo-boy, have 
                    some others had some fun with Trans program.<br>
                    Well, forewarned is forearmed. I bought replacement DME &amp; 
                    Fuel Pump relays - no change.<br>
                    Had an auto electrician check the battery and alternator - 
                    all fine.<br>
                    Dismantled and cleaned the gear selector switch - better but 
                    still happening.<br>
                    Cleaned and then replaced gear selector switch - still happening.</p>
                  <p>After consulting this forum, my contact in Sydney, and the 
                    Service rep at BMW Sydney the one conclusion was reached. 
                    Service the tranny and replace the Tranny Speed Sensor. This 
                    is a $90 part which should take the whole transmission service 
                    to around $220.<br>
                    Couldn't get in to BMW Sydney as it was before Easter and 
                    they were totally booked out for 2 weeks. Tried a mechanic 
                    semi-referred to me. Decided that his diagnosis (that the 
                    2nd &amp; 3rd gear clutches were slipping so the tranny needed 
                    rebuilding and would cost me $3,000) was a bit off the mark.</p>
                  <p>Next decision was to try a Transmission Specialist. Took 
                    the car in and gave the guy the history. He took the car for 
                    a day just to check it out. His diagnosis was that the tranny 
                    was essentially running well, but the sensor or perhaps solenoids 
                    could be faulty. Left the car with him while away on business 
                    for a few days so he could have a really good look at it.<br>
                    $220 later the tranny is purring like a kitten, okay maybe 
                    a tiger....</p>
                  <p>Drove the car yesterday for the first time after the problem 
                    was fixed. I have a 35 minute drive to work which is on lovely 
                    winding roads with a few gentle hills thrown in for good measure. 
                    When I got to work I almost turned around to head back home 
                    and do it again. Very happy.<br>
                    I picked up my brand spanking new Bentleys 5 Series service 
                    manual yesterday. $200 from technical books in Cremorne (For 
                    you Sydney siders).<br>
                    This book is the bible that so many forum resolutions keep 
                    referring to.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>Epilog:</p>
                  <p>Forewarned is forearmed.</p>
                  <p>Buy beg borrow or steal a Bentleys manual.</p>
                  <p>Research on the forum and email a few knowledgeable sounding 
                    people for information/assistance. Everyone there is dedicated 
                    and loves to help.</p>
                  <p>Before you approach any mechanic, dealer etc, at least sound 
                    like you know what you are talking about. You are less likely 
                    to be hoodwinked by sharks.<br>
                    Be specific on what work you want done (or not done). Agree

                    1991 535i<br>
                    Bimmernut.com member</p>
                  <p>My 1991 535i has had the &quot;Trans Program&quot; error 
                    come up sporadically for about the past year. At first, all 
                    I had to do was shut the car off and wait a minute or two 
                    and it reset itself and everything ran fine. But as time went 
                    on, it was harder and harder to get it to reset. In my case, 
                    when the error message was not showing, the car shifted perfect. 
                    That lead me to<br>
                    believe that the tranny was actually working fine. I just 
                    had some sort of intermittent electrical problem. So, I began 
                    checking things in the electrical system.</p>
                  <p>The tranny is controlled by a computer, just like the engine. 
                    Anytime there is a low voltage problem, or a problem with 
                    an electrical signal from one of the sensors, the tranny computer 
                    throws up the red flag (Trans Program message), and only allows 
                    you reverse and third gears in an attempt to save itself. 
                    Unless the computer resets the error, the car will remain 
                    driveable with only these two gears. That&#146;s why the car 
                    takes so long to get moving when the error message is showing.</p>
                  <p>Before going into all the steps below, it really pays to 
                    find out if any error codes are stored in your engine computer. 
                    These codes may give you the real reason for the problem, 
                    as they eventually did for me. To learn how to download the 
                    stored codes, go to: <a href="http://www.bonnevillemotorwerks.com/fault.html">http://www.bonnevillemotorwerks.com/fault.html</a>. 
                    The reason this is important is because the engine sends signals 
                    to the tranny computer. In my car, it was a faulty signal 
                    from the throttle position sensor that was causing the problem.</p>
                  <p>You see, I had done all of the things below and continued 
                    to have the problem. Until one day, someone shared one of 
                    those priceless bits of information that cured my problem. 
                    Up to this point, the engine computer was kicking out a faulty 
                    throttle position sensor code. Well, I got out the Bentley 
                    manual, went through the diagnostics and concluded that the 
                    switch<br>
                    was fine. Hum? Well, the aforementioned gentleman had had 
                    the same problem with the same fault code and had happened 
                    to run into one of those old, seasoned BMW techs who told 
                    him to check his connectors. In particular, he told him to 
                    actually locate the wires that sent the signal from the throttle 
                    position sensor to the engine computer and trace them to the 
                    connectors. Then, with the connector apart, he told him to 
                    bend the spades for those wires slightly so that they made 
                    better contact with the female side of the connector. So, 
                    he went home, found the correct spades, bent them, and the 
                    problem went away. Seems that one of those little spades just 
                    wasn&#146;t making good contact all the time. And every so 
                    often, it would loose contact and cause the Trans Program 
                    error to come up. So, I did exactly what he did. And guess 
                    what? My problem disappeared never to rear its ugly head again.<br>
                    Hallelujah!</p>
                  <p>I will tell you that you&#146;ll need a complete wiring diagram 
                    for your car to do this. It will show you how many connectors 
                    are in the circuit, what color the wires are, what number 
                    the wires are, and sometimes, where the connector is located. 
                    I know from my experience that the Bentley manual contains 
                    all the information you&#146;ll need. But even with the correct 
                    wiring diagrams, it is hard to read those little numbers in 
                    the connectors.</p>
                  <p>Now, if your engine computer is not storing any codes, you 
                    may want to go through the steps below. First, you&#146;ll 
                    want to check for low voltage issues. <br>
                    Probably the first thing to do is have the battery and charging 
                    system checked. If the message comes up after an especially 
                    cold night, or after the car has sit for a few days, you may 
                    have a low battery. A good way to check for this problem is 
                    to take the car for a drive of a couple miles with the trans 
                    program limp home mode engaged. Unless your tranny really 
                    is<br>
                    having mechanical problems, driving it with the Trans Program 
                    message showing should not hurt it. After a couple of miles, 
                    park it, wait a minute or two, and see if it starts up without 
                    the message. My car used to do this quite often after not 
                    having driven it for 3-5 days. You&#146;ll also want to check 
                    the fluid level, have the battery load tested and make certain 
                    the alternator is charging properly. Of course while you&#146;re 
                    checking the battery, make sure the terminals are all bright 
                    and shiny. If everything here appears normal, it&#146;s time 
                    to move on.</p>
                  <p>Next, check the main power relay in the E-box (little covered 
                    box under hood in front of glovebox). The E-box cover has 
                    four screws that hold it down.<br>
                    After removing the cover, you&#146;ll notice a large box with 
                    a large connector right next to the firewall, which is the 
                    ABS control module. Now, next to it towards the front of the 
                    car are 2-4 small square plastic boxes. These are the relays. 
                    According to Bentley, the main relay is the one closest to 
                    the engine. To replace it, simply pull straight up. While 
                    you're in the e-box,<br>
                    go ahead and take a look at all of the large connectors there. 
                    Again, according to Bentley, the one for the main engine computer 
                    is the one next to the relays but towards the front of the 
                    car. . The farthest one forward is the cruise control module. 
                    I actually cleaned each of the connectors and corresponding 
                    spades with alcohol. I also cleaned the large connector going 
                    into the tranny computer. On my 1991 535i, the tranny computer 
                    was located in the passenger side lower kick panel behind 
                    the speaker. It&#146;s easy to take out, but you do have to 
                    remove the glove box and peel back the sound deadening material 
                    to get at the screws. After cleaning all of these contacts, 
                    I also applied Pro-Gold, which is a electrical connection<br>
                    conditioner. It is supposed to provide better conductivity. 
                    I purchased mine from Radioshak.com.</p>
                  <p>Next, take a look at the auto/manual shift switch near the 
                    shifter and the shifter lever position switch. Both of these 
                    switches can be accessed by removing the wood console piece. 
                    To do that, pry up the little strip with the &#147;PRNDL&#148; 
                    letters on it. Under it are two screws holding the black plastic 
                    piece that surrounds the shifter down. Once you remove those 
                    screws, you&#146;ll need to remove the shift handle. If you&#146;ll 
                    pull it back into the low gear position, you&#146;ll be able 
                    to see the set screw located in the front edge. Loosen it 
                    and pull straight up on the handle to remove it. At this point, 
                    you&#146;ll be able to remove the black plastic piece that 
                    surrounds the shifter. To remove it completely, unplug the 
                    connector going to the auto/manual<br>
                    switch. Once you&#146;ve got it out, you&#146;ll have to remove 
                    the wood piece. Just to help you, you have to hook something 
                    under the front edge of the wood and lift up. I used a small 
                    allen wrench. Once you have the wood piece off, you&#146; 
                    ll see the large shift lever position switch. The auto/manual 
                    switch is the one attached to the black plastic piece you 
                    already removed. Thoroughly clean both switches with alcohol 
                    or some other solvent designed to clean electrical contacts. 
                    My switches were filthy. I will caution you that the removal 
                    and disassembly of the switches is not for the faint of heart. 
                    If you're not mechanically inclined, I'd recommend finding 
                    someone who was before starting.</p>
                  <p>There have also been some things written about replacing 
                    the speed sensor inside the tranny itself. I bought one but 
                    never got to put it in, since bending the spades fixed my 
                    problem. This job is supposedly a do-it-yourselfer. The gentleman 
                    who helped me with my problem also suggested removing the 
                    main wiring harness connector that goes into the driver&#146;s 
                    side<br>
                    of the tranny. If you find trans fluid in the connection, 
                    it probably means that your seal has gone bad and you need 
                    to replace the tranny wiring harness. He said that he&#146;d 
                    had this problem on his car and had fixed it himself.</p>
                  <p>So there you go, About everything I know about this problem. 
                    I&#146;d been meaning to write all this down for a long time 
                    and finally did it tonight. After all the effort, I&#146;m 
                    going to save it. I might also e-mail it to a few BMW sites 
                    to see if someone will post it. Anyone who&#146;s done other 
                    things to cure this problem should post so that I can include 
                    it in this narrative.<br>

                  <p><b>More information from</b> <b>Dan Zeitlin </b></p>
                  <p> My experience with TRANS PROGRAM fault in a 1995 525i (E34 
                    M50TU) <br>
                    <br>
                    TRANS PROG suddenly appeared while driving. No prior symptoms. 
                    Trans switched to 3rd gear mode and car was limped home. Thereafter, 
                    TRANS PROG message came onwith ignition switch. Car started 
                    and ran smoothly and normally. No codes that Peake tool could 
                    read were set. Went through the ritual of resetting the computer(s) 
                    amd checking switches and connectors and cleaning contacts. 
                    Reseated the ECU connector. No joy. Finally, after removing 
                    the Transmission Computer (EGS) and ohming out all the remote 
                    devices through the EGS connector and deciding they all looked 
                    consistent with each other and good, I remated the EGS connector 
                    and turned the key. All was well. The fault had disappeared. 
                    I assume the connector needed reseating, or that the fault 
                    is intermittent and I will be seeing it again. Nonetheless, 
                    I do have the mesaurements of the transmission-related devices 
                    as seen through the EGS connector. Presumably they are good 
                    units, so the readings may be useful to someone else. The 
                    readings are consistent with what can be expected for these 
                    types of devices. I subtracted the 0.2 ohm resistance of the 
                    leads and probes. <br>
