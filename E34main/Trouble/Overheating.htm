                  <p>A major problem with the Bmw E34/E32 especially the <b>BMW 
                    M30</b> 3.5l out of the 535i: <b>overheating</b>.<br>
                    Don't expect the headgasket to last long in these conditions. 
                    <br>
                    The temperature needle should be at the <b>1/2 mark all the 
                    time</b>. If the needle is near the 3/4 mark or red area, 
                    you have an overheating problem, fix it soon.</p>
                  <p>On the <b>BMW E34 525i 92</b> on and the <b>E36 325i/is</b> 
                    with <b>M50 engine</b>, the engines were fitted with plastic 
                    impellers waterpumps. These waterpumps fails, the impeller 
                    desintegrates and you are left with no waterpump at all... 
                    the engine overheats. You need to check that you have a waterpump 
                    with metal impeller. Change your waterpump ASAP if yours has 
                    a plastic impeller.</p>
                  <p><b><font color="#009900" size="+1">Understanding the cooling system:</font></b><br>
              &#149; The <b>waterpump</b> (centrifugal type) is driven by a belt. 
              It allows the coolant to circulate.<br>
              &#149; The <b>thermostat</b> controls the coolant flow into the 
              radiator. Closed when the engine is cold (nothing goes in the radiator, 
              open when the engine gets warm to flow the coolant inside the radiator 
              and cool it down.<br>
              &#149; The <b>primary coolant fan</b> is mounted to the front of 
              the waterpump with the fan clutch.<br>
              &#149; The <b>fan clutch</b> is a viscous fluid type that control 
              the speed of the fan based on engine compartment.<br>
              &#149; A two speed <b>auxiliary cooling fan</b> is mounted in front 
              of the condenser. It is uses when the A/C operates and when coolant 
              temperature exceeds 196F (91C)<br>
              &#149; The fan shroud is also an important item not to overlook: 
              the presence of a shroud, with about 1/2" to 3/4" clearance between 
              the tips of the fan blades & the shroud opening, and the fan inserted 
              about 1/2 way into the shroud opening is essential for efficient 
              cooling performance. </p>
            <p>First: make sure that your radiator is in good condition, check 
              the belts, the hoses and the coolant level. Make sure that there 
              is no coolant leaks. Check the condition of the shroud for cracks 
              & its proper installation.</p>
            <p><b>Car fluid or coolant circuit element just changed:</b><br>
              Your overheating is probably due to air trapped into the coolant 
              circuit. Use the bleed screw to <a href="../Maintenance/Engine/Coolant%20replacement.htm">bleed 
              the circuit</a>. Then bleed again, again, again and again.</p>
            <p><b>Nothing had been changed, car is overheating while idling or 
              heavy traffic:</b><br>
              1. Check that the thermostat works and opens.<br>
              2. Check the fan clutch.<br>
            </p>
                  <p><b>Car overheating while driving. Not stop and go.</b><br>
                    1. Bleed the cooling circuit.<br>
                    2. Check the thermostat.<br>
                    3. Check the water pump.<br>
                    4. On the 535i, check the bypass hose located and attached 
                    just above the upper hose neck on radiator and runs along 
                    the inner walls to the Resivior tank. If it is plugged, the 
                    car will overheat.<br>
                  </p>
            <p><b>Overheating with A/C on, or very high temperature only.</b><br>
              1. Check that the auxiliary fan is working properly(Bentley manual 
              page 170-4).<br>
              2. Check the fan clutch.</p>
                  <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><font size="+1">How to check the thermostat:</font></b></font><br>
              A slow working thermostat is hard to diagnose. When the engine is 
              warming up and the temperature needle is near center, touch the 
              top radiator hose. If hot, the thermostat is working (could still 
              be a slow one). If there is cold area in the hose or radiator, check 
              the thermostat.</p>
                  <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><font size="+1">How to test the 
                    fan clutch:</font></b></font><br>
                    Sorry guys, the newspaper test is not reliable. If the thermostat 
                    doesn't work or is slow moving, the fan clutch will fail the 
                    newspaper test and will spin freely don't even bother explaining 
                    how it is done as it is dangerous.<br>
                    What you should do: <br>
                    1) make sure that the thermostat is working!<br>
                    2) when the car is cold, the fan clutch should turn with a 
                    small resistance and not spin freely.<br>
                    3) Let the car idling and the hood not closed but down. After 
                    5-10 min, the temperature will rise at the 1/2 mark, check 
                    that the fan is blowing a LOT of air inside the engine compartment 
                    and increase in noise level, no need to put your hands, you 
                    will feel it. If when the temperature hits the 3/4 mark, the 
                    fan is not blowing a lot of air, that means that: either the 
                    thermostat is not working or slow, or the fan clutch is bad.<br>

                    <a href="Data/Overheating.jpg" target="_new"><b>Picture from

                    Dave enlarged the hole on the end of the pipe from the radiator 
                    to the expansion tank.</p>
                  <p>The pipe that runs from the radiator to the expansion tank 
                    is about 1/4 inch diameter (internal) , but just as it enters 
                    the expansion tank it reduces in size down to 1/64 inch diameter. 
                    this pin hole is what was blocking and causing overheating... 
                    I have enlarged the hole by running a 1/4 drill down the pipe 
                    and this should prevent any futher blockage.</p>
                  <p><b>Great Overheating write up from Arnold Matusz</b>.<br>
                    The interesting thing about how this all began is that I gave 
                    my car for a little test drive to a friend who normally drives 
                    like crazy.<br>
                    When I drove the car everything seemed allright, but when 
                    he gave me the key and I got into the car, the engine coolant 
                    was so hot that it would probably have bent the water indicator 
                    needle in my dashboard. First I thought he really stood on 
                    the gaspedal instead of &quot;on the seat&quot; and thought 
                    it needed a little cooling down time! But it was really aukward 
                    because an engine should cool itself down at 600RPM and 6000RPM 
                    aswell!<br>
                    <br>
                    I waited a bit for it to settle down but it didn't help much 
                    as I've turned the engine on ... it immediately boiled the 
                    water. So it was clear that the coolant system had a bug (thermostat, 
                    not enough coolant, headgasket, waterpump ...)<br>
                    As my dad is a car mechanic he immediately spotted that the 
                    thermostat was blocked in a closed position. This normally 
                    prevents the water to flush through the radiator so that the 
                    engine can't cool itself down!<br>
                    To change the radiator you only have to remove the thermostat 
                    housing (if you can get hold of the little seal in the housing 
                    do it, it's worth it) replace the thermostat and put back 
                    the housing. Don't forget to clean the surface so the housing 
                    can close 100% on the head ... to prevent any water leaks.<br>
                    After all these have been done we noticed how difficult it 
                    is to bleed the coolant system! It was impossible not difficult! 
                    The engine was still overheating, now we thought the reason 
                    was that the thermostat is closed, there's not enough water 
                    around it (air trapped inside the system) and this is why 
                    the engine is overheating. But the thermostat was working 
                    just fine.<br>
                    Then we suspected taht the headgasket had some crack and that 
                    part of the compressed air-fuel mixture from the cylinder 
                    is escaping through the crack into the coolant system! It 
                    was pretty viable as the engine overheated a few times! So 
                    we changed that aswell!<br>
                    But when we got back to fill up the coolant system with coolant 
                    ... it still didn't want to bleed itself through.<br>
                    The interesting part is that the engine could be cooled down 
                    if you use the heater in the car. The radiator from the heating 
                    system acts almost as the normal radiator, it blows loads 
                    of hot air into the cabin thus cooling the engine down! <br>
                    The next step was to change the water pump, although it didn't 
                    seem a very viable solution, as it gave a no good explanation 
                    why there is heating in the system! <br>
                    When we took out the water pump the <b><font color="#FF0000">PLASTIC 
                    IMPELLER</font></b> remained inside the head. That's when 
                    we got really happy as we found the reason for the whole overheating 
                    problem! </p>
                  <p><b>Overheating troubleshooting!</b><br>
                    0 - check coolant level<br>
                    1 - check if thermostat works<br>
                    2 - headgasket replacement<br>
                    3 - water pump replacement<br>
                    4 - check the head for cracks</p>
                  <p>BUT if you've got <b>BMW M50</b> (525i after 89) engine the 
                    order is a bit changed! (these models tend to have a <b><font color="#FF0000">plastic 
                    impeller</font></b> on the water pump which suddenly walls 
                    down from the shat that should drive it ... so you actually 
                    end up with water not moving around at all in the egine - 
                    thus the extremely rapid overheating)<br>
                    0 - check coolant level<br>
                    1 - check if thermostat works<br>
                    2 - check the waterpump<br>
                    3 - check the fan clutch <br>
                    4 - check the cooling fans for the radiator<br>
                    5 - replace headgasket<br>
                    6 - check the head for cracks<br>
                    7 - replace engine if all these won't work :P</p>
                  <p><b>CAUTION: </b>when you mount the new thermostat handle 
                    the thermostat housing with allot of precaution because it 
                    can easily crack and you end if with a leak (where not only 
                    water escapes but the engine can get air inside the coolant 
                    system which is a bag factor when it comes to overheating).<br>
                    When working on your coolant system and you are buying parts: 
                    always ask for a metal impeller water pump, and procure a 
                    metal thermostat housing).</p>
                  <p><b>IDEA:</b> if the water pump is at faul you might cool 
                    your engine down by turning on the heater in the car ... This 
                    will let you drive it to the services, better than walking 
                    / paying for a trailer! It worked for me:)</p>
