                  <p align="left">My weekend project was the replacement of the 
                    flex disc and the center bearing support on the driveshaft 
                    of my 1992 525i. I want to personally thank Winfred Dixon 
                    for his excellent comments, advice and support for this project.<br>
                    My car was making the usual progressively worse noises associated 
                    with driveshaft related problems. I just didn't know how bad 
                    the flex disk was until I looked at my new part and compared 
                    it to what was left; basically just the bolts in the steel 
                    sleeves surrounded by the remnants of the rubber and strings 
                    of thin cord that was imbedded in the rubber. I am amazed 
                    the car even moved!<br>
                    <br>
                    Before attempting this project I purchased a 3 1/2 ton floor 
                    jack and 4 substantial jack stands. The Bentley manual mentions 
                    at 1/2 page intervals that the car should be on jack stands 
                    at the jacking points before getting under the car.<br>
                    The reason I wanted to attempt this job was primarily to save 
                    several hundred dollars but also to prove to myself that I 
                    could do it. BMWs are made well but they can also be a tough 
                    to work on. <br>

                        The BMW stealer wanted $110 for the flex disk and $88 
                        for the center support bearing. I paid $39.95 and $32.00 
                        respectively for the parts from BMA. I also needed to 
                        order 6 new self-locking nuts for the driveshaft and 6 
                        self-locking nuts for the flex disk; I ordered them from 
                        the stealer for a cost of $8.00. The floor jack I picked 
                        up for $60.00 and the jack stands cost me $62.00. I also 
                        picked up a 19mm combination box wrench and a 1/2 inch 
                        drive 19mm socket for a total of $14.00. Lastly, I purchased 
                        a 1/2 drive 1 1/4 extended socket for <br>
                        $7.00. My total costs including the tools I purchased

                        did not touch the oil pan and raised the car approx. 20

                        exhaust as much as possible. The Bentley manual says to 
                        remove the exhaust, however, that is a lot of work and 
                        not necessary. Before lowering the exhaust I positioned 
                        the floor jack under and just touching the rear muffler. 
                        Working from the rear muffler there are two muffler clamps 
                        that require a 13mm socket. Moving forward and just before 
                        the center resonator on the exhaust there were two more 
                        muffler brackets requiring a 13mm socket for removal. 
                        Finally, there is a bracket at the front secured to the 
                        rear of the transmission that required a 13mm socket to 
                        loosen the two bolts. Once everything was loose, I slowly 
                        lowered the exhaust with the floor jack as much as possible 
                        but still supporting it.</td>

                        There were approximately 6 bolts that required either 
                        a 13mm socket or 13mm combination box wrench. Once the 
                        bolts are out you need to finagle the heat shield out 
                        and put it on the floor <br>
                        and out of the way.<br>
                        3. The next item was the removal of the bolts from the 
                        flex disk. Keeping the car in park (I have an automatic 
                        trans)I found that BMW really puts these bolts in tight. 
                        I couldn't even budge them with my breaker bar. Using 
                        my 19mm wrench on the nut and 19mm socket on the bolt, 
                        I finally broke the nut loose by sliding and 18 inch piece 
                        of pipe over my wrench for some leverage. To access each 
                        bolt I had to turn the driveshaft by hand after taking 
                        the car out of park and repositioning my wrench. <br>

                        the rear of the driveshaft. Before you remove the driveshaft 
                        paint on marks where it pulls apart for proper alignment 
                        when being reinstalled. They required a 13mm wrench and 
                        the length of pipe to break them loose.<br>

                        It was held in place by two bolts that require a 13mm 
                        socket.<br>
                        6. Once the driveshaft was loose, I lowered the exhaust 
                        a little more and worked the driveshaft out and onto the 
                        floor. </td>

                  <p align="left"><br>
                    7. Although my center bearing was not damaged, at the suggestion 
                    of Winfred Dixon I replaced it anyway, just in case. The center 
                    bearing is pressed on between the front and rear drive shaft. 
                    In order to access the center bearing, the front and rear 
                    drive shaft have to be taken apart. There is a 19mm bolt that 
                    holds them together. Before taking the driveshaft apart I 
                    pained marks on the front and rear driveshafts near the center 
                    bearing for proper alignment later. I had to put the rear 
                    of the driveshaft in my bench vise to work on this. The bolt 
                    holding the two together is really in there! Using my 19mm 
                    box wrench with the 18 inch pipe slid over the wrench for 
                    leverage, I finally broke it loose. The bolt was a tough out 
                    requiring small turns and effort to the last thread. I needed 
                    to take a few turns and tap the rear of the driveshaft to 
                    loosen it from the front spline until it finally came off 
                    the spline. The center bearing is pressed on over the spline. 
                    I used a hammer and an old dull chisel to carefully loosen 
                    the center bearing and then slide it off.<br>
                    8. Replacement of the center bearing was easy; you just have 
                    to make sure that it is positioned correctly. I used my 1/2 
                    drive 1 1/4 inch extended socket to firmly tap the center 
                    bearing into place. <br>
                    9. The driveshaft was now ready to be bolted together. I put 
                    a little CRC on the inside threads of the spline to make putting 
                    the bolt in a little easier. Positioning the front and rear 
                    driveshafts according to the painted marks, I bolted them 
                    together in the same fashion as I took the bolt out. Be sure 
                    that the bolt is tight.<br>
                    10. Now the driveshaft was ready to be installed. I bolted 
                    the rear of the driveshaft up first using the new 13mm self-locking 
                    nuts. You can access 3 of the bolts at a time. I had to position 
                    a screwdriver through the area where the front and rear shafts 
                    meet to keep the drive shaft from turning while I was tightening 
                    the bolts. Also, I found it easier to mount the center bearing 
                    only putting the bolts in finger tight during the process.<br>
                    11. Next was to intstall the flex disk. In order to do this 
                    I had to unbolt the center support bearing so that I could 
                    slide the front of the driveshaft into the center bearing 
                    and onto the transmission spline. Its important to note that 
                    there is a certain way that the flex disk is installed. There 
                    are 3 flanges on the front drive shaft that will positioned 
                    at the rear of the flex disk and 3 flanges that are on the 
                    transmission spline that will be positioned at the front of 
                    the flex disk. The flex disk has arrows imbedded in the rubber 
                    that point to either the front transmission spline or the 
                    rear drive shaft spline. Those arrows need to aligned correctly. 
                    Once done, intstall the bolts and nuts and tighten appropriately 
                    with 19mm wrench and socket wrench.<br>
                    <b>Note from Rich W.</b> <br>
                    One comment - on the page that describes the replacement of 
                    the flex disk and center support bearing, the work description 
                    skips over the need to avoid torquing the bolt on the &quot;soft&quot; 
                    side of the buigo. As you know, putting serious torque to 
                    the end of the bolt on the disk side rather than doing your 
                    wrenching on the flange side places a serious strain on the 
                    cord in the guibo, leading to premature failure. Not good!! 
                    This should be included I think.<br>
                    Finally reinstall heat shield, exhaust brackets and lower 
                    car. </p>
                  <p align="left"><b>NOTES from Peter H.</b><br>
                    I used my Bentley manual and your website for reference. Both 
                    are great resources. This is the first time that I have ever 
                    encountered any discrepecies in either the book or your website. 
                    I had the driveshaft off and was looking for the collar to 
                    loosen to separate the two halves of the driveshaft at the 
                    spline and there was none! I looked at it, consulted both 
                    pages in the book and the website because I figured that I 
                    must be missing it, but it wasn't there. So off to the dealer 
                    with driveshaft in hand. I got there and talked to the sevice 
                    manager and he said sometimes you have to replace the driveshaft!! 
                    They took it, said it would be about 1.5 hours labor after 
                    they looked at it and said they could call when it was done. 
                    They called later in hte afternoon and said it was done with 
                    a bill of 148.35 for labor and shop charges. I also had them 
                    press off and install the new centerbearing while they had 
                    it since I could not separate the shaft myself. In all I spent 
                    about $220 for everything and it works great. I just wanted 
                    to tell you so that the website could let everone know that 
                    if they take this on, while a fairly staight foward operation, 
                    they might have a little problem with the driveshaft. Thanks 
                    for all the great information. I hope I could be of some help 
                    to other people that love their cars!!<br>
